    /// The ThreadPool class represents a pool of threads, which in a sense is a queue of threads managed by .NET.
    /// ThreadPool manages two types of threads:
    /// Worker Threads: These are threads performing general tasks.
    /// I/O completion port thread: These execute I/O operations like disk operations.
    /// ThreadPool is used by various components in .NET such as WCF, ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, TPL, PLinq, essentially throughout the entire .NET ecosystem.
    /// You can't create your own thread pool, and that makes sense. As you can see, the thread mechanism is very complicated.
    /// If you were to poorly write an application that, for example, creates an enormous number of threads,
    /// not only would you crash your application, but you could also destabilize the entire system it runs on.
    /// So why not create a default ThreadPool mechanism that handles this for you?
    /// ThreadPool has a mechanism for maintaining an optimal number of threads.
    /// For example, in an ASP.NET Core application, imagine that each HTTP request actually corresponds to a new thread.

        /// Now, it's worth noting what this minimum number represents. The minimum doesn't determine the starting number of threads for every.NET application.
        /// Instead, it indicates how quickly new threads should be created in your application.
        /// When this number is exceeded, it creates new threads intermittently.
